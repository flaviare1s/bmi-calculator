    What your BMI result means
    A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
    healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
    such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
    fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
    strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
    five days a week.
    Healthy eating
    Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better digestion,
    immunity, mental clarity, and mood.
    Regular exercise
    Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces disease
    risk, fostering wellness and longevity.
    Adequate sleep
    Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting
    overall restoration and rejuvenation.
    Limitations of BMI
    Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
    every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
    certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
    Gender
    The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
    a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.
    Age
    In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
    body fat content.
    Muscle
    BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
    differentiate muscle from fat.
    Pregnancy
    Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
    healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
    and child.
    Race
    Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
    lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
    GP or practice nurse.
